# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Loading the data

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
skim(yrbss)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms.

There are 1004 missing values in weight, and distribution of weight is right skewed.

```{r, eda_on_weight}
yrbss %>% 
  filter(is.na(weight)) %>% 
  summarize(missing_count = n()) #number of missing observations in weight

yrbss %>% 
  ggplot(aes(weight)) +
  geom_histogram() + #plot the distribution of weight
  theme_bw() + #theme
  labs(title = "distribution of weight") # add title
```

Next, we consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity.

Let’s create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise.

  
```{r}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

yrbss %>% filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count),
         se = sqrt(prop*(1-prop)/count),  #calculate stand error
         t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), #calculate t critical for 95% CI
         CI_low = prop - t_critical*se,
         CI_high = prop + t_critical*se)  #calculate high end for 95% CI)

```

The  95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week is 0.317 to 0.345.
  

In the following we make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. 

```{r, boxplot}
yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = physical_3plus, y = weight, color = physical_3plus)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "boxplot of physical_3plus vs. weight") +
  theme_bw()
```
The median `weight` of `physical_3plus==yes` is larger, and there are more extreme `weight` of `physical_3plus==no`. I expected the median `weight` of `physical_3plus==yes` to be smaller because they tended to consume more energy, however that is not what the data shows. Maybe this is because people who do sports 3 times a week or more, are muscular and therefore heavy. Muscles are heavier than fat.

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test.

```{r}
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
            upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
            )

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Null Hypothesis (h0): There is no difference of mean weights for students who exercise compared to those who do not.
Alternative Hypothesis (h1): There is a difference of mean weights.

```{r}
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```



## Hypothesis test with `infer`

Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. We will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

After we have initialized the test, we need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r}
null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```

This is the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.
As the p-value is 0 we can conclude to withdraw our null-hypothesis.

# 2. IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

In the following we are looking into the IMDB ratings of two directors.
We will reproduce the following graph and run statistic tests.

```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

We load the data and examine its structure.

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```


```{r director_rating}
director_rating<-movies %>% 
  filter (director %in% c('Tim Burton','Steven Spielberg'))%>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean_rating = mean(rating),
            sd_rating = sd(rating),
            t_critical_95 = qt(0.975, count-1),
            lower_bound_95 = mean_rating - t_critical_95 * (sd_rating/(count)^0.5),
            upper_bound_95 = mean_rating + t_critical_95 * (sd_rating/(count)^0.5)) %>% 
  select(director,mean_rating,lower_bound_95,upper_bound_95) 
  
  
director_rating
```
```{r plot_director_rating}
ggplot(director_rating, aes(x = mean_rating, y = reorder(director,mean_rating))) +
  geom_point(aes(size = 4, color=director))+
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmax = upper_bound_95, xmin = lower_bound_95,x=mean_rating,color=director,xlab=),width=0.05,size=1.5)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position='none')+
  geom_rect(ymin = 0, ymax = 4, xmin = director_rating$lower_bound_95[1], xmax = director_rating$upper_bound_95[2], alpha = 0.2)+
   geom_text(aes(label=round(mean_rating,2)), nudge_y = 0.1, size = 6) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(lower_bound_95,2), x=lower_bound_95),nudge_y = 0.1)+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(upper_bound_95,2), x=upper_bound_95),nudge_y = 0.1)+
  labs(title='Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?',
       subtitle='95% confidence intervals overlap',
       y='',
       x='Mean IMDB ratings')+
    theme(plot.title=element_text(size=15))
```
Because the confidence intervalls are overlapping (grey bar), we have to do a test to see whether the difference in means is statistically significant or not.

H0: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is equal to zero

H1: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is not equal to zero

t = 2.7144, p-value = 0.01078

```{r, director_testing}
#hypothesis testing with infer package
director_test<-movies %>% 
  filter (director %in% c('Steven Spielberg','Tim Burton'))

t.test(rating~director, data=director_test)

mean_diff<-  
  director_test%>%
  specify(rating~director)%>%
    calculate(stat="diff in means", order= c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))
  
  mean_diff
  
  set.seed(1234)
  
  diff_in_means<-director_test%>%
  specify(rating~director)%>%
  hypothesise(null='independence') %>% 
  generate(reps=1000,type='permute') %>% 
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order= c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))


  diff_in_means %>%  visualize()+
    shade_p_value(obs_stat = 0.643, direction = "both")
  
  diff_in_means %>%
    get_p_value(obs_stat=0.643, direction="both")
```
Because of the p-value and the graph above we can reject our null hypothesis that the difference in means is 0 and therefore, we can say that the the means differ given a confidence intervall of 95%.


# 3. Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination

In this section we want to determine whether there is a pay discrimination between man and women at Omega Group Plc.

## Loading the data

```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

summary <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender)%>%
  summarize(
    mean_salary = mean(salary, na.rm=TRUE),
    sd_salary = sd(salary, na.rm=TRUE),
    count = n(),
    se_salary = sd_salary/ sqrt(count),
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1 ),
    lower = mean_salary - t_critical * se_salary,
    upper = mean_salary + t_critical * se_salary
  ) 

print(summary)

```
Based on our analysis above, we can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between male and female salaries because the confidence intervals does not overlap. 
95% confidence interval:
  men: 70008-76390 
  women: 61486-67599

We then run hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. We run our hypothesis testing using t.test() and with the simulation method from the infer package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary~gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(4321)
diff_observed<-omega%>%
  specify(salary~gender)%>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order=c("male","female"))
diff_observed

```
We can reject our null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean salary between men and women, as  the p-value is close to 0 and the t-test a t-value of -4.

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

We calculate the 95% confidence interval. 
```{r}
experience_ci <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender)%>%
  summarize(
    mean_exp = mean(experience, na.rm=TRUE),
    sd_exp = sd(experience, na.rm=TRUE),
    count = n(),
    se_exp = sd_exp/ sqrt(count),
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1 ),
    lower = mean_exp - t_critical * se_exp,
    upper = mean_exp + t_critical * se_exp
  ) 

print(experience_ci)
```
From this we can conclude that there is a significant difference in experience between male and female as the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap. 
Furthermore we can do a t-test:

```{r}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 

t.test(experience~gender, data=omega)
```

```{r}
# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(4321)
experience_null <- omega %>%
  specify(experience~gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null="independence")%>%
  generate(reps=10000,type="permute")%>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order= c("male", "female"))

obs_diff_exp <- omega %>%
  specify(experience~gender)%>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order=c("male","female"))

experience_null %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat=obs_diff_exp, direction="two-sided")
```

For both test, the p-value is very small or 0 and therefore we can reject our null hypothesis (h0: no difference in experience of male and female). 

This insight endangers our previous insight (that there is a salary difference between male and female). This means that it could be that not the sex attribute is the reason for the sales difference but the experience attribute is. 

## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Here we analyse the relationship between salary and experience with a scatter plot.

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
omega %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=experience, y=salary)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title="Positive relationship between salary and experience exists...", subtitle= "Salary vs. experience at Omega Group Plc.", x="Experience (years)", y="Salary (USD)")

```

## Checking correlations between the data

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

In the salary vs experience scatterplot we see the data points being coloured by gender. This shows us, that men with low experience also get paid little and women with higher experience get paid better. 
There are many female datapoints with low experience and many male datapoints with high experience. This graph therefore, rather shows us that women get indeed paid less but this is because they tend to have less experience than average men working at Omega Group Plc.


# 4. Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten.

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

Our dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

## Plotting the yield curve

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

We want to reproduce the following graph:

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r graph1_yield_curve, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
yield_curve$var <- factor(yield_curve$var, levels =myvars)

ggplot(yield_curve, aes(x=date, y=price, colour = var))+
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE, group=1)+
  facet_wrap(~var, ncol = 2)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960", 
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x="",
       y="%")
```



### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

We want to reproduce the following graph:

```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r, challenge1_plot2, fig.width=10}

library(lubridate)

plot2 <- yield_curve%>%
  mutate(year = year(date), 
         month = month(date))%>%
filter(year >= 1999)

ggplot(plot2, aes(x=maturity, 
                  y=price, 
                  colour=year, 
                  group=date))+
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 4)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title= "US Yield Curve",
       caption = "Source: St. Loius Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x= "Maturity",
       y= "Yield (%)")+
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(30))


```



### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

We want to reproduce the following graph:

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r plot3, fig.width=15, fig.height=12}

plot3 <- plot2%>%
  filter(maturity %in% c("3m", "10y"))

ggplot(plot3, aes(x=date, y=price, colour= var))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  labs(title = "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x="",
       y="%")

```

To plot our final graph we will

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions <- recessions%>%
  filter(year(from) >=1960)
```

Then we continue to plot the graph:

```{r , plot4, fig.width=15}
plot4 <- yield_curve%>%
  select(date, symbol, price)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = price)%>%
  mutate(diff = GS10 - TB3MS)
  
ggplot(plot4, aes(x=date, y=diff))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0),color="black")+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=ifelse(diff>0, diff,0)),fill="blue",alpha=0.2)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=ifelse(diff<0, diff,0),ymax=0),fill="red",alpha=0.2)  +
  geom_rect(data=recessions, 
            inherit.aes = FALSE, 
            aes(ymin=-Inf, 
                ymax= Inf, 
                xmin=From, 
                xmax=To), 
            fill = "black",

This graph shows us that the yield curve actually flattens before recessions. Therefore, a flatten of the yield curve can predict an upcoming recession.
Furthermore, since 1999 the 3-month yield more than a 10-year:
- 2000
- 2006-2007


# 5. Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). 

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. 
We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory.

```{r read_GDP_data, eval=FALSE}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing we need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and we must make it into long, tidy format.

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(4:51), names_to = "years", values_to = "value") %>%
  filter(years >= 1970)%>%
  select(-1)%>%
  mutate(value_bn = value/(10^9))%>%
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when(
        IndicatorName %in%  "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household expenditure",
        IndicatorName %in%  "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Government expenditure",
        IndicatorName %in% "Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports",
        IndicatorName %in% "Imports of goods and services" ~ "Imports", 
        IndicatorName %in% "Gross capital formation" ~ "Gross capital formation"
  ))%>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% c("Gross capital formation", 
                              "Exports",
                              "Government expenditure", 
                              "Household expenditure", 
                              "Imports" ))

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","Turkey", "Germany")

```

First, we reproduce the following graph (but exchanging Turkey for India).

```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r plot_GDP, fig.width=10}
plot1 <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list)

plot1$IndicatorName <- factor(plot1$IndicatorName, levels =  c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports"))

ggplot(plot1, aes(x=years, y=value_bn, colour = IndicatorName))+
  geom_line(aes(group=IndicatorName))+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1970, 2017, by = 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12500, by= 2500))+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       x="",
       y="Billion US$",
       colour = "Components of GDP")+
  theme_bw()
```

GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in our dataframe, we calculate it by using its components discussed above.

The following graph shows the % difference between what we calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe:

```{r GDP_calc}

plot2 <- plot1 %>%
  group_by(Country, years)%>%
  mutate(value_bn = case_when(
    IndicatorName == "Imports" ~ value_bn*(-1),
    IndicatorName != "Imports" ~ value_bn
  ))%>%
  summarise("GDP_sum"=sum(value_bn))

GDP_data <- UN_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(4:51), names_to = "years", values_to = "value") %>%
  filter(years >= 1970)%>%
  mutate(value_bn = value/(10^9))%>%
  filter(IndicatorName =="Gross Domestic Product (GDP)")%>%
  select(Country, years, value_bn)%>%
  rename(GDP_from_data=value_bn)
  
comparison <- left_join(plot2, GDP_data, by = c("years" = "years", "Country"="Country"))%>%
  mutate(difference = GDP_sum - GDP_from_data, 
         in_percent = difference/GDP_from_data)

ggplot(comparison, aes(x= years))+
  #geom_line(aes(y=GDP_sum, group=1), colour = "blue")+
  #geom_line(aes(y=GDP_from_data, group=1), colour = "red")+
  geom_line(aes(y=in_percent, group =1))+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1970, 2017, by = 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  labs(title = "Less difference occures over the years...",
       subtitle = "Difference between GDP from sum and GDP from data",
       x="",
       y="Difference of GDP in %")+
  theme_bw()
 
```
We see that the difference seems to be quite small (<5%), but a difference exists!

Now we will reproduce the following graph:

```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r, challenge2_plot3, fig.width=15}
plot1 <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list)

plot1 <- plot1 %>%
  select(Country, IndicatorName, years, value_bn)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, values_from = value_bn)%>%
  mutate(Net_Export = Exports-Imports)%>%
  select(-6)%>%
  select(-6)

plot3 <- left_join(plot1, plot2)%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 'Household expenditure': Net_Export, names_to = "GDP_component", values_to = "Proportion" )%>%
  mutate(Proportion = Proportion / GDP_sum)

ggplot(plot3, aes(x=years,y=Proportion, colour = GDP_component))+
  geom_line(aes(group=GDP_component))+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1970, 2017, by = 10))+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "",
       y ="proportion",
       title = "GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars", 
       colour = "" ,
       caption = "Source: United Nations, http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads")
  
```

This chart tells us how the different components of the GDP (i.e. Government Expenditure, Gross capital formation, Household Expenditure and Net Exports) vary over the years as a percentage of the total GDP of Germany, India and the United States.
For all countries in 2017 the biggest item for GDP is Household Expenditure, then followed by Gross capital formation, Household Expenditure and Net Exports being the smallest contribution to the national GDP.
We see that Net Exports are rising for Germany between 2000 and 2017 while it stayed stable and declined slightly for India and the United States. Also Net Exports is positive for Germany while it is negative for India and the US. Rising net exports are bad for other countries because they start to owe even more money to strong-exporting nations, i.e. Germany. 
Government Expenditures were stable for Germany and India, however declined strongly for the US. 
Gross capital formation declines for Germany, stays about the same for the US and increases strongly in the 2000s and 2010s for India. This can be explained by the Solow-Model: As Germany and the US are developed countries they are already closer to the "Steady State" and grow their capital at a smaller rate than for example India, which is farer away from their steady state.
Household Expenditure declines slightly in percentage for Germany, declines strongly for India and grows for the US.
